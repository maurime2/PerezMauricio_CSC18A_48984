Assignment #8:

Take our Date class that we created
Add six new methods named: 

	- nextDay
	- previousDay
	- nextMonth
	- previousMonth
	- nextYear
	- previousYear.

nextDay:
The method should increment the current day to the next day. 
You will need to make sure that it will increment to the next month or next year if needed. 
	For example:
		Date is 7/31/2015, the method should increment the date to: 8/1/2015
		(since 7/32/2015 is an impossible date). 
	
		Date is 12/31/2015, the method should increment the date to 1/1/2016.

previousDay:
The method should decrement the current day to the previous day. 
You will need to make sure that it will decrement to the previous month or previous year if needed. 
	For example:
		Date is 8/1/2015, the method should decrement the date to: 7/31/2015
		(since 8/0/2015 is an impossible date). 
		Date is 1/1/2016, the method should decrement the date to 12/31/2015.

nextMonth:
 Method should increment the current month to the next month. 
 You will need to make sure that it will increment to the next year if needed. 
 	
	For example:
	
		Date is 12/31/2015, the method should increment the date to: 1/31/2016 (since 	13/31/2015 is an impossible date). 
		
		Date is the following: 1/29/2013, as there is no such date: 2/29/2013?
		(I'm leaving this up to you to decide how to handle this impossible date since the year 2013 was not a leap year).

previousMonth: 
Method should decrement the current month to the previous month. You will need to make sure that it will decrement to the previous year if needed.
	
	For example:
		
		Date is 1/31/2016, the method should decrement the date to: 12/31/2015 (since 0/31/2016 is an impossible date).
		
		Leap year: Date is the following: 3/29/2013, as there is no such date: 2/29/2013? 
		(I'm leaving this up to you to decide how to handle this impossible date since the year 2013 was not a leap year).

nextYear:
Method should increment the current year to the next year. 
This should be relatively straightforward since there are no special considerations that need to be made when incrementing the year to the next year.

previousYear:
the method should decrement the current year to the previous year. 
	
	What should happen if the date is the following: 2/29/2000, as there is no such date: 2/29/1999? 
	
	(I'm leaving this up to you to decide how to handle this impossible date since the year 1999 was not a leap year).

Assignment is due 11/19/15 by the beginning of class, working source code and 3-4 sentence write up must be emailed for up to 40 points.
