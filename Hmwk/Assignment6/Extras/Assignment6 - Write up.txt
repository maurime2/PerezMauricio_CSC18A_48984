   Assignment 6: Problem 18.14 (Palindromes)
 
   Problem:  	A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same way forward
				and backward. Some examples of palindromes are “radar,” 
				“able was i ere i saw elba” and 
				(if spaces are ignored) “a man a plan a canal panama.” 
			
					Write a recursive method "testPalindrome".
						- "testPalindrome" returns boolean value true if the
						  string stored in the array is a palindrome.
						- false otherwise. 

					The method should ignore:
						- spaces.
						- punctuation.
