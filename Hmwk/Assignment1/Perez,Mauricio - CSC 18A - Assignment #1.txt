Hello, my name is Mauricio S. Perez. I am 28 years old and I am officially a full time student at RCC. I am taking 5 Computer Science courses including this one.

I am a Electrical Engineering major, but am currently taking CS as a second major. I attended UCR in the fall of 2004 up to 2009. I did not do well. I am currently trying to finish a degree in EE. My hope is that finishing courses in CS will get me into a State School.

My goal is to finish the Computer Science Associates Degrees in C++ and in Java. Hopefully this will grab a recruiters attention. If not, then I will try to go into the job market with said skills and attempt to build up from their.

I like to ride my bike, play basketball, swim, hike, run and eat. I don't discriminate when it comes to food. I believe in trying something once before claiming that its good or bad.

I also like to travel. This is more due to my girlfriend's need to travel. Truth be told, other than the other outdoor activities, I used to be a home body. My relationship with her has forced me to go out more and experience life and other things around my natural area.

As a job, I fix computers. I like to refurbish old tech, and making it just as good as new tech. I have been reformatting computers scene I was 11. I learned accentually after destroying my Windows 95 software. I was trying to install a Star Wars game, and I somehow deleted important windows operating system files. I remembered that someone told me if the computer did not start, to pop a CD in, and it would re install everything. I followed that instruction and I was back to windows in a few hours. I did manage to install my Star Wars game shortly after.

I hope to finish this course with a greater understanding of JAVA, and thus putting my skills to work in a real life environment.

Thanks for your time:

Mauricio S. Perez
