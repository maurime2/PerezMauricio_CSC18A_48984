   Problem: Chapter 7 Exercise #11 (Invoice Class), due 11/5/15 by the beginning
            of class, working source code and 3-4 sentence write up must be 
            emailed for up to 40 points.

            7.11 (Invoice Class)

            Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to 
            represent an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice
            should include four pieces of information as instance variables:
                - A part number (type String).
                - A part description (type String).
                - A quantity of the item being purchased (type int).
                - A price per item (double). 

            Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four 
            instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance
            variable.
            
            In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates
            the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per
            item), then returns the amount as a double value. 
                If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. 
                If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0. 
            
            Write a test app named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoiceâ€™s 
            capabilities.

    Write Up:
                NOT FINISHED. NEED TEST CLASS "InvoiceTest".

                The classes work. With initial inputs, Invoice class creates 
                their part number, part description, quantity and price per
                item.

                getInvoiceAmount also works as it should. The class only 
                multiplys the quantity by the ppi of the item, giving an overal
                total value of the inventory.
