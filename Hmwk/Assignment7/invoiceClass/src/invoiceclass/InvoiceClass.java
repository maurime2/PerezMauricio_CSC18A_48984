   Assignment 7: Problem 7.11 (Invoice Class)
 
   Problem: Chapter 7 Exercise #11 (Invoice Class), due 11/5/15 by the beginning
            of class, working source code and 3-4 sentence write up must be 
            emailed for up to 40 points.

            7.11 (Invoice Class)

            Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to 
            represent an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice
            should include four pieces of information as instance variables:
                - A part number (type String).
                - A part description (type String).
                - A quantity of the item being purchased (type int).
                - A price per item (double). 

            Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four 
            instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance
            variable.
            
            In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates
            the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per
            item), then returns the amount as a double value. 
                If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. 
                If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0. 
            
            Write a test app named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoiceâ€™s 
            capabilities.
